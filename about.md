I am a Data Scientist who runs [The Broadline](http://thebroadline.com) - an experiment to reimagine journalism for the web using awesome technology. I occassionally consult for companies, and have helped folks across Singapore, India and the Middle East improve their businesses through analytics and Machine Learning. I am always looking for great people to work with, so please do reach out if you are interested in knowing more about what I do.

I previously ran product and data science at [Deepo](http://deepo.io), a data-science startup that democratizes the power of smart, predictive algorithms for marketers and editors.

### Other Interests

I love Data Journalism, Sports Analytics, and Social Innovation. If you play around in any of these fields, please hit me up! Coffee will be on me :)
