title: Bully Yourself
---

_"I bully myself, 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to."_ - Eminem

It has been two years since I posted on this blog. A lot has happened since then. I taught myself web-development and data-science, tried and failed to get an [ed-tech startup](http://quiztra.com) off the ground, spent a year in India doing [data-journalism](http://blog.thenumerateindian.com) and data-science consulting, and co-founded a [data science startup](http://deepo.io) that currently serves some of the biggest media companies around the world.

It has been a crazy ride. I have been hit, repeatedly, by failure over the past two years. Some of the major ones have been:
- Getting 25+ rejections while hunting for a job as an NUS undergraduate
- Failing to make my ed-tech startup profitable after working on it for 7 months (and subsequently closing it down)
- Failing to get clients to pay for some consulting projects completed in India (tip: always sign a formal contract before you start working with clients)
- Getting rejected by some top Indian business schools

I was close to breaking down after some of these. It was very tempting to join a 'normal' job at large companies, and not have to worry about the myriad problems that running a startup/consulting company entails.

I'm glad I didn't.

Here are some of the things I did instead:
- Spent 14 hours a day over a 3 month period teaching myself data-science, through free online courses
- Published data-driven analysis of social issues and sports, which received more than 2.5 million views, and was covered by major publications in India, United States and England
- Competed on Kaggle, and ending up in the top 2% of data-scientists worldwide
- Helped one of the largest media sites in India use data to automate decisions
- Co-founded a data-science startup in Singapore that does content-recommendation-as-a-service, among other things. We currently serve some large media sites in South-East Asia, as well as the largest media site in Dubai

I'm sure that some very significant failures are yet to come, but the past two years have made me realize that this is a good thing. Failing sporadically is a sign that you are reaching for things that are not easily reachable. Failure also acts as as a sharp wake-up call, and tells you that you will lose badly if you don't up your game.

It is easier said that done though. Failure is extremely taxing. It makes you question your worth as a person. It makes you hate well-meaning people who innocuously ask "Where do you work?", or "How is your company doing?". It makes you less receptive to folks who want to help, mistaking their efforts for pity.

If you let it, a single large failure can irrevocably limit your career and personal growth. It is easy to develop a defense mechanism than tells you to stop trying anything in which you might fall flat on your face. Why do something that might hurt you terribly, when you can stick to the status quo and coast along?

And that is why you must bully yourself.

It's comforting to blame circumstances and other people for your failure. Don't. Bully yourself to improve instead.
It's easy to fear that the time and effort put into a new project/startup/self-development-activity might end up in nothing. Bully yourself and do it anyway.
It's very tempting to let the adversities in your personal life affect your work. Bully yourself, and stop feeling sorry for yourself.

Far too many people admit that they are not entirely satisfied with their life, but feel the lack the skills to improve it. But we live in an era where anyone with an internet connection that learn almost any skill (including how to code, and how to build a company) for free on Coursera, Udacity, edX, MITx or HarvardX. And we also live in an era where it is ridiculously cheap and fast to build out digital prototypes that you can get feedback on.

There are too many people I have met lately who are insanely smart and talented, but still lead lives that they are unhappy with, because they refuse to bully themselves. That is a travesty.

Good things do not comes to those who wait patiently. Good things come to those who shake the world until it gives them what they want.
